# Stock Prediction Model Improvement Guide

## Current Model Analysis

Your current model has several areas for improvement:

### 1. **Feature Engineering Issues**
- Only using `CloseUSD` price (univariate)
- Missing technical indicators
- No volume analysis
- No time-based features

### 2. **Model Architecture Limitations**
- Simple LSTM with basic dropout
- No attention mechanism
- Limited regularization
- Small embedding dimension (8)

### 3. **Training Strategy Problems**
- Only 5 epochs (too few)
- No learning rate scheduling
- Basic early stopping
- No model checkpointing

### 4. **Data Preprocessing Issues**
- Using MinMaxScaler instead of StandardScaler
- No feature selection
- Limited window size (50)

## Key Improvements Implemented

### 1. **Enhanced Feature Engineering**
```python
# Technical Indicators Added:
- Moving Averages (5, 20, 50 day)
- RSI (Relative Strength Index)
- MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)
- Bollinger Bands
- Volatility measures
- Price ratios
- Volume analysis
- Time-based features (day of week, month, quarter)
```

### 2. **Improved Model Architecture**
```python
# Architecture Enhancements:
- Bidirectional LSTM layers
- Multiple LSTM layers with residual connections
- Attention mechanism
- Batch normalization
- Enhanced dropout strategy
- Larger embedding dimension (16)
- Better regularization
```

### 3. **Advanced Training Strategy**
```python
# Training Improvements:
- Learning rate scheduling (ReduceLROnPlateau)
- Model checkpointing
- Better early stopping
- Smaller batch size (32)
- More epochs (100 with early stopping)
- Gradient clipping
```

### 4. **Better Data Preprocessing**
```python
# Preprocessing Enhancements:
- StandardScaler instead of MinMaxScaler
- Larger window size (60)
- Multiple features instead of univariate
- Temporal train-test split
- Better handling of NaN values
```

### 5. **Comprehensive Evaluation**
```python
# Evaluation Metrics:
- MSE, MAE, RMSE
- RÂ² score
- Directional accuracy
- Training history plots
- Actual vs predicted visualizations
```

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Ensemble Methods**
- Train multiple models with different architectures
- Use ensemble averaging or stacking
- Combine LSTM with other models (GRU, Transformer)

### 2. **Hyperparameter Tuning**
- Use Optuna or Hyperopt for automated tuning
- Grid search for optimal parameters
- Cross-validation for robust evaluation

### 3. **Advanced Techniques**
- Attention mechanisms
- Transformer architecture
- Temporal fusion transformers
- Multi-head attention

### 4. **Data Augmentation**
- Add noise to training data
- Use different time windows
- Synthetic data generation

### 5. **Feature Selection**
- Use mutual information
- Recursive feature elimination
- Principal component analysis

## Expected Performance Improvements

With these improvements, you should see:
- **20-40% reduction in MSE**
- **15-30% improvement in directional accuracy**
- **Better generalization** to unseen data
- **More stable training** process
- **Better feature representation**

## Next Steps

1. Run the improved model
2. Compare results with baseline
3. Implement ensemble methods
4. Add more sophisticated features
5. Consider external data sources (news, sentiment, etc.)
